He wanted everyone to have a digital library at no cost. Project Gutenberg got its first boost with the invention of the web in 1990, and its second boost with the creation of distributed proofreaders in 2000. Distributed proof-readers are a web-based project that supports the development of e-texts. This helped project Gutenberg by allowing many people to work together in proofreading drafts of e-texts for errors. In 2010 Project Gutenberg offered more than 33,000 eBooks being downloaded by Tens of thousands every day.([Source: Project Gutennurg](https://www.gutenbergnews.org/)).
